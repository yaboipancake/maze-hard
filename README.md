# Maze

For this assessment, you'll be making a maze game where you have to get Chok
from the starting square to the finish square.

## Getting Started
To get started, _fork_ this repository into your own GitHub account then clone
this repository to your local machine:

```console
foo@bar:~ $ git clone git@github.com:github-username/maze.git
foo@bar:~ $ cd maze
foo@bar:~/maze $
```

Note `github-username` above. In other words, __don't__ simply copy-paste the
code above blindly into a terminal. 

Next, Open "maze.js", scroll to "START HERE", and start coding!

You may also wish to look at the other code to get a grasp of how the game
works as a whole, but I suggest doing so _after_ you've taken a look at "START
HERE".

## Difficulty Levels

There are 4 difficulties:
- easy
- medium
- hard
- epic

Medium is the default. If you complete it and would like to try another
difficulty, commit your changes and switch to that branch.

The following will save your progress in "medium" mode, and move on to hard:

```console
foo@bar:~ $ git add .
foo@bar:~ $ git commit -m "I just finishd medium mode."
foo@bar:~ $ git checkout hard
```
